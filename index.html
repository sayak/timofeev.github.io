<p>Going off course</p>

<p>Forecast</p>

<p>
It's been ten years since I told you<br>
That it’s forever: these trees, these fields, these misfortunes,<br>
These modest, timid successes,<br>
These roadside cafes, peddling vacant air<br>
And unfashionable music,<br>
These days, when parents bring their kids<br>
To school for the first time,<br>
Feeling a wrenching mix of anxiety and joy;<br>
These apples, this morning fog in the gullies,<br>
These canned peas, glory<br>
Of the national salad.<br>
And you spoke of shopping malls from here to the horizon,<br>
Stacks of glossy magazines right by the door,<br>
Endless six-lane highways,<br>
Driving right into the sea,<br>
Nights that pass into days<br>
Like one hard currency into another.<br>
And where is all that? I ask you<br>
At a bus stop,<br>
Decorated with a simple announcement<br>
Of the loss of two Dachshunds, female, with dark coloration.<br>
It was generated on a printer<br>
Two days ago.<br>
</p>

<p>Her Oil</p>

<p>
Oil comes out of her kneecaps.<br>
Her knees are oozing with oil.<br>
On a good day you can accumulate<br>
A half-liter bottle,<br>
By dragging the lip along her skin,<br>
Catching unctuous drops.<br>
And what can you do about that?<br>
The doctors just hold consultations;<br>
At least they haven't sounded off to the press.<br>
Her relatives are already used to her<br>
Always wearing those snug black<br>
Leggings with special padding<br>
On the knees to soak up all the droplets.<br>
Oil is her daily routine.<br>
She even keeps an eye on prices,<br>
Market fluctuations, like someone’s pulse,<br>
Slightly feverish, dynamic, alive,<br>
And unfathomable. Lately<br>
She feels like she’s a whole<br>
Oil-producing nation herself—<br>
A state, confident of its own significance.<br>
Look how she crosses the street,<br>
How she laughs, goes shopping.<br>
It’s no biggie that she gets rid of the oil<br>
In the bath, repeatedly wiping away heavy<br>
Black drops. In this life of ours<br>
She has oil. What have you got?<br>
</p>

<p>Figures of Speech</p>

<p>
The touching, naive, somehow sincere<br>
Fighter jet flew over the river. The ripe,<br>
Pomaded tank cozily set its treads down,<br>
Approaching the woods. Intimately, childishly, a thump<br>
Was heard from the salvo fire system. Happy, contented<br>
Infantrymen ran off somewhere. Growing in the sky were<br>
Smoky, blooming flowers of explosions.<br>
A slight, stubby general promised<br>
To seize everything possible by midnight. The happy<br>
Mischievous correspondent held before him<br>
A microphone with the number of his channel. TV-viewers<br>
Rejoiced and puffed up in bliss at the broadcast.<br>
The soapy war foamed up before them in all<br>
Its unctuous luster. The sun shimmered.<br>
</p>

<p>Questions</p>

<p>
Have we held enough blackberry in the palms of our hands,<br>
Or cloudberry, cranberry? Didn’t suspiciously many<br>
Unripe berries come our way, or to the contrary,<br>
Slightly bruised ones, a little brown on the sides?<br>
Have we stepped softly over carpets of August woods?<br>
Flicked flashlights on at night’s darkest hour?<br>
Worked in sawmills—as mysterious, taciturn<br>
Figures, wiping away the sweat? Slept on hillocks<br>
Arms thrown wide? Gradually become the model of<br>
Messy, incomprehensible handwriting? Left<br>
Palm prints in the sandy banks of an unhurried<br>
Stream? Untangled obdurate, taut branches?<br>
Have we lived our lives well to the present moment?<br>
Always been in the right? Did we miss something important?<br>
</p>

<p>Bugs, Boughs</p>

<p>“I’ve become a bad person—<br>
everywhere I see bad things,”<br>
said a passenger<br>
in an intercity bus to me<br>
in the course of a hushed evening conversation.<br>
“In the trees I see bugs;<br>
in poetry — tautology;<br>
in politicians’ speeches — politicians’ speeches.<br>
Maybe it won’t last forever,<br>
and some day I'll again see<br>
in the trees — elegance of boughs;<br>
in poetry — generosity of nuance;<br>
in politicians’ speeches — alternatives for the future.<br>
But for now its like a wall. You understand,<br>
its just my problem. The world<br>
is still absolutely, absolutely<br>
magnificent.” And he fell silent, looking out the window<br>
at a house, slipping away into the dark,<br>
with a pair of lit windows,<br>
where they were watching a TV show, it seems,<br>
with chocolates and strong tea.<br>
</p>

<p>Proposal</p>

<p>
Let’s head into the murky nothingness.<br>
Roughly 20 km of murky nothingness,<br>
Then make a left turn,<br>
Then another 200 meters.<br>
Right there is this bar with the best espresso<br>
Made from special Kenyan beans.<br>
They also have Costa-Rican,<br>
For people who put milk in their coffee.<br>
But they don’t have anything else,<br>
Not even customers, by the way.<br>
Nothing to hang your hat on even.<br>
Complete nothingness.<br>
</p>


<p>
The Forest Starts Here<br>
The forest starts after the city.<br>
Trash bins stand<br>
with the admonition<br>
“Preserve the forest!”<br>
That’s where you toss trash<br>
when entering the forest,<br>
all that junk from your pockets,<br>
and then you advance with jaunty step<br>
along the path<br>
penetrating into space<br>
without highways<br>
with dark underbrush<br>
and dry twigs.<br>
This is where rapists hide out<br>
and the shades of partisans.<br>
Here you promise<br>
to talk less<br>
and talk less.<br>
You stride in monotone,<br>
taking pleasure in steady oxygen<br>
in your lungs, in the fact that<br>
there’s nothing pressing, you have no<br>
debts to speak of, you have your passport,<br>
identification document,<br>
and driver’s license with you.<br>
You are aware of who<br>
you are, and its pleasant to forget it,<br>
stepping into the thickening darkness<br>
loosing bearings, vigorously<br>
going off course.<br>
</p>

<p>The Ritz</p>

<p>
Inlaid with a blue mosaic
Showing the lode stars, the floor
Of the spa-bath and the circumspect illumination
Along with the sound of coursing water,
As though in eternal pursuit of itself,
Predisposes you to a philosophical mood. Now it’s
Midday and no one is around, except somewhere
In the depths behind the glass a shadow flits by
Of a dark-haired woman in white, checking
Whether there are still enough snow white towels
And bath robes. There are more than enough. The tall
Shelves, reaching to the ceiling, are piled with rolled up
Waffle-textured bundles. All the same, they
Don’t lie close together, each has space around it,
And, just as surely, the guests here are one-offs.
After rising out of the Jacuzzi and wiping yourself dry,
You put on a robe, tie the belt,
Stick your feet in white, terrycloth slippers,
And walk past the leather chaise-lounges and
The sports facility, past the glass
Shelves with various body products, to come out 
By the mirrors near the elevators. The doors open,
You insert your card and press the button
For your floor. You are on the eighth. 808. As though
Caught between two infinitudes. You are a lost
Participant from the conference on partnership. Due to a computer glitch 
It’s been three weeks and they haven’t checked you out yet. You go to
The breakfast, where you have your own table, and leave
Chocolates in the room for the maids, young fair-haired
Girls, hopelessly polite and pedantic. The abundant
Breakfast is enough to last you all day, and in the evening you can grab
A kebab, and then go chase rabbits on the lawns of the huge
Park. By this hour it’s being criss-crossed almost exclusively
By cyclists. You sleep well, with closed windows and 
The AC turned on. When they at last discover
Their mistake, you’ll probably be able to hide and lie low 
in the depths. So long as there is the blue mosaic.

<p>Truths</p>

<p>
I want to tell you simple truths,
Reveal important things to you.
Always open doors, step into elevators,
Go upstairs, move down corridors.
Always get into cars, start the engine,
And if it’s winter, wait until it warms up.
Always spend money, but sparingly,
And only once in a while spend everything you’ve got.
In summer it will be summer; in fall it will be fall,
Don’t get flustered; don’t do anything that disgusts you.
Girls will become young women, and then you’ll notice
them crossing the street holding little kids’ hands.
Men will somberly weigh the options
But then act according to circumstances, often making mistakes.
Governments are made to fall;
Ships – to glide beneath bridges.
All the same, the lights on the other side of the river
Will never – imagine that – never go out.
Still, if they do, pack your bag –
Only the essentials – and leave the city immediately.
When you arrive in a new place, look around, lean against a tree;
You can light up – if you smoke – stand around, think.
You see, here too in the evening they drink tea and in the morning, coffee.
Blame the mayor and wait for things to get better.
And if there is a river and you see lights on the other side,
That’s something to cling to.
</p>
