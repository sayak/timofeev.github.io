<p class="header">Going off course</p>

<p class="title">Forecast</p>

<p>
It's been ten years since I told you<br>
That it’s forever: these trees, these fields, these misfortunes,<br>
These modest, timid successes,<br>
These roadside cafes, peddling vacant air<br>
And unfashionable music,<br>
These days, when parents bring their kids<br>
To school for the first time,<br>
Feeling a wrenching mix of anxiety and joy;<br>
These apples, this morning fog in the gullies,<br>
These canned peas, glory<br>
Of the national salad.<br>
And you spoke of shopping malls from here to the horizon,<br>
Stacks of glossy magazines right by the door,<br>
Endless six-lane highways,<br>
Driving right into the sea,<br>
Nights that pass into days<br>
Like one hard currency into another.<br>
And where is all that? I ask you<br>
At a bus stop,<br>
Decorated with a simple announcement<br>
Of the loss of two Dachshunds, female, with dark coloration.<br>
It was generated on a printer<br>
Two days ago.<br>
</p>

<p class="title">Her Oil</p>

<p>
Oil comes out of her kneecaps.<br>
Her knees are oozing with oil.<br>
On a good day you can accumulate<br>
A half-liter bottle,<br>
By dragging the lip along her skin,<br>
Catching unctuous drops.<br>
And what can you do about that?<br>
The doctors just hold consultations;<br>
At least they haven't sounded off to the press.<br>
Her relatives are already used to her<br>
Always wearing those snug black<br>
Leggings with special padding<br>
On the knees to soak up all the droplets.<br>
Oil is her daily routine.<br>
She even keeps an eye on prices,<br>
Market fluctuations, like someone’s pulse,<br>
Slightly feverish, dynamic, alive,<br>
And unfathomable. Lately<br>
She feels like she’s a whole<br>
Oil-producing nation herself—<br>
A state, confident of its own significance.<br>
Look how she crosses the street,<br>
How she laughs, goes shopping.<br>
It’s no biggie that she gets rid of the oil<br>
In the bath, repeatedly wiping away heavy<br>
Black drops. In this life of ours<br>
She has oil. What have you got?<br>
</p>

<p class="title">Figures of Speech</p>

<p>
The touching, naive, somehow sincere<br>
Fighter jet flew over the river. The ripe,<br>
Pomaded tank cozily set its treads down,<br>
Approaching the woods. Intimately, childishly, a thump<br>
Was heard from the salvo fire system. Happy, contented<br>
Infantrymen ran off somewhere. Growing in the sky were<br>
Smoky, blooming flowers of explosions.<br>
A slight, stubby general promised<br>
To seize everything possible by midnight. The happy<br>
Mischievous correspondent held before him<br>
A microphone with the number of his channel. TV-viewers<br>
Rejoiced and puffed up in bliss at the broadcast.<br>
The soapy war foamed up before them in all<br>
Its unctuous luster. The sun shimmered.<br>
</p>

<p class="title">Questions</p>

<p>
Have we held enough blackberry in the palms of our hands,<br>
Or cloudberry, cranberry? Didn’t suspiciously many<br>
Unripe berries come our way, or to the contrary,<br>
Slightly bruised ones, a little brown on the sides?<br>
Have we stepped softly over carpets of August woods?<br>
Flicked flashlights on at night’s darkest hour?<br>
Worked in sawmills—as mysterious, taciturn<br>
Figures, wiping away the sweat? Slept on hillocks<br>
Arms thrown wide? Gradually become the model of<br>
Messy, incomprehensible handwriting? Left<br>
Palm prints in the sandy banks of an unhurried<br>
Stream? Untangled obdurate, taut branches?<br>
Have we lived our lives well to the present moment?<br>
Always been in the right? Did we miss something important?<br>
</p>

<p class="title">Bugs, Boughs</p>

<p>“I’ve become a bad person—<br>
everywhere I see bad things,”<br>
said a passenger<br>
in an intercity bus to me<br>
in the course of a hushed evening conversation.<br>
“In the trees I see bugs;<br>
in poetry — tautology;<br>
in politicians’ speeches — politicians’ speeches.<br>
Maybe it won’t last forever,<br>
and some day I'll again see<br>
in the trees — elegance of boughs;<br>
in poetry — generosity of nuance;<br>
in politicians’ speeches — alternatives for the future.<br>
But for now its like a wall. You understand,<br>
its just my problem. The world<br>
is still absolutely, absolutely<br>
magnificent.” And he fell silent, looking out the window<br>
at a house, slipping away into the dark,<br>
with a pair of lit windows,<br>
where they were watching a TV show, it seems,<br>
with chocolates and strong tea.<br>
</p>

<p class="title">Proposal</p>

<p>
Let’s head into the murky nothingness.<br>
Roughly 20 km of murky nothingness,<br>
Then make a left turn,<br>
Then another 200 meters.<br>
Right there is this bar with the best espresso<br>
Made from special Kenyan beans.<br>
They also have Costa-Rican,<br>
For people who put milk in their coffee.<br>
But they don’t have anything else,<br>
Not even customers, by the way.<br>
Nothing to hang your hat on even.<br>
Complete nothingness.<br>
</p>


<p class="title">The Forest Starts Here</p>

<p>
The forest starts after the city.<br>
Trash bins stand<br>
with the admonition<br>
“Preserve the forest!”<br>
That’s where you toss trash<br>
when entering the forest,<br>
all that junk from your pockets,<br>
and then you advance with jaunty step<br>
along the path<br>
penetrating into space<br>
without highways<br>
with dark underbrush<br>
and dry twigs.<br>
This is where rapists hide out<br>
and the shades of partisans.<br>
Here you promise<br>
to talk less<br>
and talk less.<br>
You stride in monotone,<br>
taking pleasure in steady oxygen<br>
in your lungs, in the fact that<br>
there’s nothing pressing, you have no<br>
debts to speak of, you have your passport,<br>
identification document,<br>
and driver’s license with you.<br>
You are aware of who<br>
you are, and its pleasant to forget it,<br>
stepping into the thickening darkness<br>
loosing bearings, vigorously<br>
going off course.<br>
</p>

<p class="title">The Ritz</p>

<p>
Inlaid with a blue mosaic<br>
Showing the lode stars, the floor<br>
Of the spa-bath and the circumspect illumination<br>
Along with the sound of coursing water,<br>
As though in eternal pursuit of itself,<br>
Predisposes you to a philosophical mood. Now it’s<br>
Midday and no one is around, except somewhere<br>
In the depths behind the glass a shadow flits by<br>
Of a dark-haired woman in white, checking<br>
Whether there are still enough snow white towels<br>
And bath robes. There are more than enough. The tall<br>
Shelves, reaching to the ceiling, are piled with rolled up<br>
Waffle-textured bundles. All the same, they<br>
Don’t lie close together, each has space around it,<br>
And, just as surely, the guests here are one-offs.<br>
After rising out of the Jacuzzi and wiping yourself dry,<br>
You put on a robe, tie the belt,<br>
Stick your feet in white, terrycloth slippers,<br>
And walk past the leather chaise-lounges and<br>
The sports facility, past the glass<br>
Shelves with various body products, to come out<br>
By the mirrors near the elevators. The doors open,<br>
You insert your card and press the button<br>
For your floor. You are on the eighth. 808. As though<br>
Caught between two infinitudes. You are a lost<br>
Participant from the conference on partnership. Due to a computer glitch<br>
It’s been three weeks and they haven’t checked you out yet. You go to<br>
The breakfast, where you have your own table, and leave<br>
Chocolates in the room for the maids, young fair-haired<br>
Girls, hopelessly polite and pedantic. The abundant<br>
Breakfast is enough to last you all day, and in the evening you can grab<br>
A kebab, and then go chase rabbits on the lawns of the huge<br>
Park. By this hour it’s being criss-crossed almost exclusively<br>
By cyclists. You sleep well, with closed windows and<br>
The AC turned on. When they at last discover<br>
Their mistake, you’ll probably be able to hide and lie low<br>
in the depths. So long as there is the blue mosaic.<br>

<p class="title">Truths</p>

<p>
I want to tell you simple truths,<br>
Reveal important things to you.<br>
Always open doors, step into elevators,<br>
Go upstairs, move down corridors.<br>
Always get into cars, start the engine,<br>
And if it’s winter, wait until it warms up.<br>
Always spend money, but sparingly,<br>
And only once in a while spend everything you’ve got.<br>
In summer it will be summer; in fall it will be fall,<br>
Don’t get flustered; don’t do anything that disgusts you.<br>
Girls will become young women, and then you’ll notice<br>
them crossing the street holding little kids’ hands.<br>
Men will somberly weigh the options<br>
But then act according to circumstances, often making mistakes.<br>
Governments are made to fall;<br>
Ships – to glide beneath bridges.<br>
All the same, the lights on the other side of the river<br>
Will never – imagine that – never go out.<br>
Still, if they do, pack your bag –<br>
Only the essentials – and leave the city immediately.<br>
When you arrive in a new place, look around, lean against a tree;<br>
You can light up – if you smoke – stand around, think.<br>
You see, here too in the evening they drink tea and in the morning, coffee.<br>
Blame the mayor and wait for things to get better.<br>
And if there is a river and you see lights on the other side,<br>
That’s something to cling to.<br>
</p>
